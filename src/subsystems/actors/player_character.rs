// Purpose: Defines the Player actor, which represents the user-controlled
// character in the game.
//
// Contents:
// - Player struct: Represents a player in the game.
// - Implementation of the Actor trait for Player.
//
// When to use:
// - Use this as a template for creating the main player character.
// - Extend or modify this struct to add player-specific functionality.
// - This example demonstrates how to implement an actor that uses tick-based updates.


///////////// Imports /////////////
//  Import a few things we need  //
//  to create this type          //
